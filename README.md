== ESA CONTROLLER ==

ESA Controller is a glue for some ESA related applications.
In its current state, it can subscribe to run-data from Charleon's SpeedControl and pass ith through to the Youtube Upload Script by Oromit.

Further it will be able to take the youtube ID and make a new record on ESAVods.com with the run for people to find.

ESA Controller is a  Node.js application built on Express.
It uses no database, instead opting for a static configuration and responsive dataflow (very buzzwordy).
